# Bubble-Dynamics-rayleigh-plesset-AE370
Engineering dynamics problem: Numerical simulation of the Rayleigh-Plesset system to model the dynamical behavior of a bubble. 

## Project Overview
This project numerically solves the Rayleigh-Plesset equation to study the dynamics of cavitating bubbles in a liquid medium. We investigate bubble oscillation, collapse behavior, and the effects of various physical parameters on bubble dynamics.

## Research Objectives
1. **Constant Pressure Dynamics**: Observe bubble behavior under static ambient pressure
2. **Bubble Collapse Mechanism**: Analyze the physical causation leading to violent bubble collapse (inertial cavitation)
3. **Driven Pressure Effects**: Study how varying acoustic driving pressure amplitudes influence bubble oscillation characteristics

## Numerical Methods
Tested the following numerical methods for an initial value problem:
- **RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4th Order)**
- **Hybrid RK4 + Adams-Bashforth 4**

Confirmed the numerical methods through convergence analysis
